# Pong
This is my attempt to make the old school arcade game pong on the game boy advance. 

# How to play?
Download any GBA emulator, my personal choice is mGBA because it works on everything. On a keyboard, the keybinds are

Up Arrow - move paddle up
Down Arrow - move paddle down
x - freeze enemy paddle in place for 30 frames (0.5 sec)

While playing the game with the enemy paddle movement rate at 1px/frame it was unbeatable because the CPU would always be able to defend. 
The alternative was to set it to 1px/2frames but that was way too slow. So I ended up keeping it at 1px/frame and giving the player
the ability to have one shot to freeze the enemy paddle per turn and if you miss your chance it is back to being impossible.
